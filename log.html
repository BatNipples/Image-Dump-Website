		<h1 id="reportTitle">Website Project Report</h1>
		<p>For my website project, I have attempted to follow web standards and specification guide lines during the development of the website. The ways I have demonstrated this include using external cascading-style-sheets and java-script files to make the website run using a minimum amount of resources while allowing for a simplified and efficient way of editing the website e.g. font colours/font styles/ background colours/ amount of interactable buttons. It is important to find a balance between resource intensive animations and calculations and efficiency to satisfy all potential users of the service. Poor practice includes embedding styles and scripts in the web pages / using overtly complicated formatting causing the file to be expensive and time consuming to edit / allowing the website to be non-operable across a wide range of platforms and mediums. To get around these issues, I have used a consistent formatting for the source code, allowing it to be followed with minimal effort, I have used external JS and CSS files to edit and manipulate the web pages which can be accessed and changed with minimal effort. I have also tested my website across 3 different browsers. Advantages of web standards  –  Allows people with smaller bandwidths to enjoy the same performance as every other user of the web page. Reduces the cost of maintenance which allows users to enjoy the most up to date experience. Users with outdated devices and software can still have access to a satisfactory web service.  People with disabilities are not disadvantaged as they have access to the same experience as all other users would. Disadvantages of web standards – Limits the use of new and helpful tools for web development/ slows down development of high end web technology. There is no space for intensive websites unless every user had the latest and fastest equipment. In conclusion web standards are very important for the world wide web as a whole. with internet connections becoming living standards, it is important that as many people as possible have access to the same information and experience as every other user. If every developer had completely free reign over everything they did, users without strong internet connections would be at a large disadvantage.</a>
